# FlickBoard Privacy Policy

We (FlickBoard) do not track you, however possible.

By default, the keyboard does not save anything you type, even locally.
In a few cases, users may opt into local tracking to help deliver certain features. These are
clearly
signposted, and will never be shared or uploaded anywhere.

When you install FlickBoard through a marketplace (such as Google Play), the marketplace will
usually connect that to your marketplace user account, as well as generic identifiers such as your
Android version and device model.

Additionally, Google Play will collect crash logs when the app crashes or freezes, and forward them
to us. This is not something we can control or disable.
