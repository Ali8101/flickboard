# FlickBoard

FlickBoard is a flicking-style keyboard, in the style of [MessagEase] and [Thumb-Key].

## What does it look like?

## Why not MessagEase?

It's proprietary, and is currently threatening everyone's existing installations unless they
subscribe.

## Why not Thumb-Key?

Thumb-Key intentionally doesn't support some gestures that MessagEase supports.
