# AI Policy

Contributions that use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc) will not be accepted.

# Layouts

Generally, the easiest way to contribute a new layout is by copying and modifying the
[english layout](https://github.com/nightkr/flickboard/tree/main/app/src/main/java/se/nullable/flickboard/model/layouts)
for your needs.

# Bugs and Feature Requests

Bugs and feature requests can be reported at https://github.com/nightkr/flickboard/issues.
Please try to search for whether an existing issue already exists for your topic.

# Pull Requests

Generally, pull requests for layouts that follow the general conventions are welcome.

Pull requests for features and bugfixes depend on the complexity of the issue, and should first
be discussed in their corresponding issue. While I'd like to support (almost) every feature, I have
to prioritize ensuring that the codebase stays maintainable (to me).
